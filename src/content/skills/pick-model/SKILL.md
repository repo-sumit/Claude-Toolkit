# Pick Model

Classify user's task → recommend optimal model with reasoning.

## Instructions

1. Parse task description from `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Classify against decision matrix below
3. Output recommendation using format template

## Decision Matrix

### Technical Tasks

| Model | When to Use |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Haiku** | Simple transforms, formatting, regex, typo fix, status query, template fill, data extraction, factual lookup (no reasoning), file conversion |
| 🟡 **Sonnet** | Single-file coding, bug fix, code review, moderate debugging, test writing, PR review, standard refactoring, technical docs, API integration (known patterns) |
| 🔴 **Opus** | Multi-file refactor (3+ files), architecture/design decisions, complex debugging (multi-system), framework migration, security audit, novel algorithm design, system design with trade-offs |

### Business & Strategy Tasks

| Model | When to Use |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Haiku** | Summarization (<2K words), data extraction, status reports, simple translations, template filling, meeting notes formatting |
| 🟡 **Sonnet** | Content creation (blog, email, docs), research summaries, competitive analysis, standard business writing, persuasive proposals, marketing copy, customer communications |
| 🔴 **Opus** | Strategic planning, business model design, M&A analysis, organizational design, change management plans, competitive strategy, market entry decisions, crisis response, stakeholder management (competing interests), long-form reports (>2K words), executive presentations with nuance |

### Creative & Analysis Tasks

| Model | When to Use |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Haiku** | Basic formatting, simple data viz suggestions, straightforward categorization |
| 🟡 **Sonnet** | Creative writing, brainstorming (single framework), persona development, user research synthesis, A/B test analysis, survey analysis |
| 🔴 **Opus** | Multi-framework brainstorming (SCAMPER + Starbursting + trade-off analysis), cross-session pattern detection, bias identification, retrospective analysis, ethical reasoning, strategic foresight, scenario planning |

### Commands, Skills, Agents

| Model | When to Use |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Haiku** | Simple conversions (PDF, EPUB), format checks, simple utilities, minimal reasoning |
| 🟡 **Sonnet** | Standard workflows, context management, serialization, most skills/commands (DEFAULT) |
| 🔴 **Opus** | Strategic analysis (brainstorm, retrospectives), multi-framework reasoning, high-stakes decisions, pattern detection across sessions |

## Complexity Escalators

Upgrade one tier if task has ANY of these signals:

### Technical Escalators
- **Ambiguity**: Underspecified requirements, multiple valid interpretations → +1 tier
- **Scope**: Affects 3+ files/systems/components → +1 tier
- **Stakes**: Production system, security, data-loss risk, regulatory compliance → +1 tier
- **Novelty**: No established pattern, novel algorithm, cutting-edge tech → +1 tier

### Business Escalators
- **Multiple stakeholders**: Competing interests, need to balance trade-offs → +1 tier
- **Strategic impact**: Long-term consequences, irreversible decisions, organizational change → +1 tier
- **Political sensitivity**: Layoffs, restructuring, executive communications, crisis → +1 tier
- **Cross-functional**: Requires synthesis across domains (tech + business + legal) → +1 tier

### Cognitive Escalators
- **Pattern detection**: Requires analyzing trends across multiple data points/sessions → +1 tier
- **Bias identification**: Needs to spot blindspots, cognitive biases, assumptions → +1 tier
- **Ethical reasoning**: Moral ambiguity, fairness considerations, unintended consequences → +1 tier
- **Multi-framework**: Applying 2+ analytical frameworks simultaneously → +1 tier

**Cap at Opus.** If multiple escalators apply, still cap at Opus (don't "double upgrade").

## Decision Guidance

**When uncertain between two models:**
- **Haiku vs Sonnet**: Does it require *any* reasoning/judgment? → Sonnet
- **Sonnet vs Opus**: Are there trade-offs to balance or multiple valid approaches? → Opus
- **Default rule**: When in doubt, go one tier up (better quality > cost savings)

**Quality vs Cost trade-offs:**
- **Cost-sensitive**: Batch processing, exploratory work, drafts → prefer lower tier
- **Quality-critical**: Customer-facing, executive, production, irreversible → prefer higher tier
- **Iteration-friendly**: Can easily retry with higher tier if insufficient → start lower

**Speed considerations:**
- Haiku is ~3-5x faster than Sonnet, ~10x faster than Opus
- For latency-sensitive workflows (UI feedback, real-time), prefer Haiku/Sonnet
- For batch/async work, speed matters less than quality

## Output Format

```
[emoji] **[Model]** — [1-line reason]

💰 Cost: [lowest/medium/highest] | ⚡ Speed: [fastest/medium/slowest]

💡 [Optional: "Consider [other model] if [condition]"]
```

**Example output:**
```
🔴 **Opus** — Multi-stakeholder strategic decision with trade-offs

💰 Cost: highest | ⚡ Speed: slowest

💡 Consider Sonnet if this is exploratory (draft) rather than final recommendation
```
